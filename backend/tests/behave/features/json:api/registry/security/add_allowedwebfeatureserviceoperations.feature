Feature: AllowedWebFeatureServiceOperation Add Endpoint
    As an API client,
    I want to add new allowed operation configurations,
    so that I can secure services.

    Background: Setup baseurl, content-type and payload
        Given I use the endpoint http://localhost:8000/api/registry/security/allowed-wfs-operations
        Given I set the content type of the request to application/vnd.api+json

    Scenario: Can add as authenticated user
        Given I am logged in as User1 with password User1
        Given I set the request payload to:
