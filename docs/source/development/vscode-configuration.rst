.. _development-vscode-cfg:


================================
Visual Studio Code configuration
================================

All necessary run configurations to starting development are provided with the repository. 
The configuration file is located under ``{local-path-to-repo}/.vscode/tasks.json``.

1. Open repo in vscode
======================

Go to ``File -> Open Folder...`` and select the root folder of the downloaded repo.

2. Start container in debugging mode
====================================

Currently there are three containers which executes MrMap application logic. For all of those containers one run configuration is provided.

Use the vscode shortcut ``ctrl + shift + p`` to use the `Command Palette`.
Start typing ``tasks: r``. QuickOpen will show you possible results for your search. Select ``Tasks: Run Task`` and smash the enter button. In second autoselect listing you can now choice one of our pre configured run configurations.

For example you choose ``Docker Compose: mrmap debug gunicorn`` and smash the the enter button again, vscode will open a new terminal for you, where the docker container is running.

3. Connect with debugger to the container
=========================================

The container will show you at least ``waiting for debugging client``. Now you have to connect to the container with the integrated debugger of vscode. Again there are ready to use run configurations located under ``{local-path-to-repo}/.vscode/launch.json``.

Again you can start debugger by using the `Command Palette`. So use shortcut ``ctrl + shift + p`` again and start typing ``>debug: sel``
