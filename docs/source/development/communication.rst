Communication
=============


There are several official forums for communication among the developers and community members:

* `GitHub issues <https://github.com/mrmap-community/mrmap/issues>`_ - All feature requests, bug reports, and other substantial changes to the code base **must** be documented in an issue.
* `GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/mrmap-community/mrmap/discussions>`_ - The preferred forum for general discussion and support issues. Ideal for shaping a feature request prior to submitting an issue.
