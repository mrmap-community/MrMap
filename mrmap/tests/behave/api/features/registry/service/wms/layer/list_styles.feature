Feature: Layer Style List Endpoint
    As an API client,
    I want to search for layer,
    so that I can find relevant map content.

    Background: Setup baseurl, content-type and payload
        Given I use the endpoint http://localhost:8000/api/registry/styles/

    Scenario: Can retrieve list as anonymous user
        When I send the request with GET method
        Then I expect the response status is 200
        Then I expect that response json has an attribute "meta.pagination.count" with value "1"
        Then I expect that "2" queries where made
