Feature: MapContextLayer Move Endpoint
    As an API client,
    I want to add mapcontextlayers,
    so that I can configure map applications.

    Background: Setup baseurl, content-type and payload
        Given I use the endpoint http://localhost:8000/api/registry/mapcontextlayers/10
        Given I set the content type of the request to application/vnd.api+json

    Scenario: Can move 10 as authenticated user to parent 6, position 0 (first-child)
        Given I set the request payload to:
